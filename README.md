# WindowsProcessesGUI
Compare the processes/executables from different times on your machine side by side. This way one can view difference before and after downloads, link clicks, and opening or closing of programs.

The latest version allows two different formats. The second is the list format for the task list. It will show the image name, pid, session name, session number and memory usage on separate lines. The filter will filter out each of these that does not show up in the other list.

-No authentication needed for batch files to run on your PC.
